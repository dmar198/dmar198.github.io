The Douay Rheims Bible is a Catholic bible that was originally published in 1582 A.D. for english speakers. For almost 400 years, this bible was the primary bible for english speaking Catholics, and was frequently re-released in new editions. Its status is comparable to the King James Version. <br \/><br \/> The Challoner Version was first released in the 1700s. The commentary inside is still among the most scholarly, deep, and faithfully Catholic commentary that has ever been published in English. The Challoner Bible can truly be used as a study bible. <br \/><br \/> For this edition, I made a few optimizations to the Challoner text. For one thing, I updated the names of the biblical books to their modern spellings. The original Challoner Bible used old names for the biblical books, such as Apocalypse for the Book of Revelation, and Osee for Hosea. In this app, the titles have been updated, but the names within the text are still the old names. Hosea (the book) is called Hosea in the title, but within the book, Hosea (the prophet) is still called Osee. It is similar with the other biblical names.<br \/><br \/> One possible use for this app is with text-to-speech apps. I integrated a button into my app to allow readers to disable the verse numbers, and I put all the commentary in buttons that should not affect most screen-reading software. As a result, you should be able to safely copy-paste the contents of any book or chapter into a text-to-speech app or screen reader and hear the bible without interruptions from verse numbers.<br \/><br \/> Special thanks go to Dennis McCarthy, Tad Book, and a chapter of the Knights of Columbus in Atlanta, Georgia. Many years ago, these people helped digitize the text of the Challoner Bible. Since this text has been in the public domain for a long time now, I did not need to pay any copyrights to make this app, I just modified the text from a public resource. Please notify me of any bugs, especially typographical errors and skipped verses. I very much want to correct them. My website, with my contact info, is www.historyandapologetics.com.";}
