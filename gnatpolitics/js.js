function greatThings() {document.getElementById("content-div").innerHTML = "<b>Eight Great Things About Trump</b><br /><br /><b>Trump trade deal</b>: 75% of cars will now need to be manufactured in North America or face tax penalties, up from 62.5 percent under Nafta. 40% of car part manufacturers need to be paid $16 an hour or more by 2023. And Trump got Canada to open up its dairy market to US farmers.<br /><br /><b>Trump tax cuts</b>: The corporate tax rate went from 35% to 15%. The middle-class tax rate went from 25% to 22% for lower middle class and 24% for upper middle class. Also, people who used to pay the 15% rate now pay 12%. As a consequence, 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this year, and 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses. (Rep. Chris Collins, <a href=\"https://www.atr.org/list\">citing</a> ATR’s List of Tax Reform Good News and the Department of the Treasury’s prediction for 2018 taxes.)<br /><br /><b>Trump health reform</b>: Trump got rid of the individual mandate so that you’re no longer charged a penalty tax for not having healthcare.<br /><br /><b>Trump peace deal</b>: North Korea is no longer in a cold war with South Korea nor with the United States. After the Trump-Kim meeting, both sides showed evidence of deescalation.<br /><br /><b>Legal immigration up</b>: Under Obama, the average number of legal immigrants each year (2009 to 2016) was 1,063,590. Under Trump, that number <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2017/table1\">jumped</a> up to 1,127,167 for 2017. (2018 numbers aren’t yet available.) That’s a more than 5% gain.<br /><br /><b>Illegal immigration down</b>: In 2017 ICE removed 17% fewer illegal immigrants than it did in 2016. ICE <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2017\">attributes</a> this reduction to lower rates of illegal immigration due to the deterrent effect of Executive Order 13768 (Trump’s border patrol order).<br /><br /><b>Social issues</b>: Trump removed funding for most overseas abortions via the Presidential Memorandum Regarding the Mexico City Policy. Trump cancelled the birth control mandate by means of two HHS rules: the Religious Exemptions and Accommodations rule and the Moral Exemptions and Accommodations rule. (Though the Supreme Court had already basically cancelled it via Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.) Also, Trump’s Supreme Court is now conservative: it’s pro-life for the first time since 1972, and it’s also stronger on the second amendment and religious liberty, though it already leaned more conservative on those issues due to Justice Kennedy. (His replacement is stronger on these issues, but Kennedy wasn’t so bad on these two things either.)<br /><br /><b>Approval rating</b>: Likely voters don’t seem to mind him much. Rasmussen Reports <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/trump_approval_index_history\">gives</a> Trump an Approval Index of -3, compared with -13 on Obama’s equivalent date---October 4, 2018 vs. October 4, 2010. (The Approval Index subtracts “Strongly Disapprove” votes from “Strongly Approve” votes.) The same day’s data says that Trump has an overall approval rating among likely voters of 50% *for* and 49% *against.* (Obama had 48% *for* and 51% *against.*)";}
